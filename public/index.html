    <meta name="description" content="Our goal is to bring out the best in
            our students through practicing martial arts. To teach that through hard
            work, goals can be accomplished, through determination progress can be
            made, with courage, fear can be overcome. Just as people grow throughout
            their lives, martial arts students grow throughout their training. It is
            a long path to black belt, and at HWMA we believe that rank progression
            is not solely based on physical ability, but students' mental
            progression as well. To bring out the best in both us and our students,
            it is a path we walk together." />

     Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
     It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
     Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

     Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
     work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
     Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.
